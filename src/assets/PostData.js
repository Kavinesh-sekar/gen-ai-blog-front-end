    We're constantly seeking ways to do more in less time, to optimize our workflows, and to maximize our efficiency. 

    But what does psychology tell us about true productivity, and how can we apply these insights to work smarter rather than harder?

    Research in cognitive psychology has revealed that our understanding of productivity often conflicts with how our brains actually work. 
    For instance, multitasking—long celebrated as a productivity skill—has been shown to reduce efficiency by up to 40%. 
    When we switch between tasks, our brains need time to adjust, resulting in what psychologists call "switching costs."

    Instead, the science points to focused work as the key to genuine productivity. 
    The concept of "flow," pioneered by psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, describes a state of complete immersion in a task, 
    where challenges and skills are perfectly balanced. In this state, productivity soars, and work often feels effortless.
